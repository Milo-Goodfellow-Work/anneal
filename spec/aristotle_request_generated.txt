Analyze the Lean implementation in Spec.generated.Main and generate formal specifications.

TASK: Write theorems in Spec/generated/Verif.lean that specify the correctness of:
- All public functions and their expected behavior
- Structural invariants for data types
- Edge cases (empty inputs, bounds, etc.)

REQUIREMENTS:
1. All theorems must be fully proven (no sorry)
2. Import Spec.generated.Main to access the definitions
3. Use the namespace Spec.generated
4. Theorems should be meaningful, not trivial

The implementation file Main.lean has already been built and is available in the project context.
