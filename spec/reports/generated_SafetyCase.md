# Safety Case: generated

## Executive Summary

This document presents the safety case for the `generated` implementation,
demonstrating its correctness through a combination of differential testing
and formal verification.

## Verification Approach

### Stage 1: Co-Generation with Differential Testing

The C implementation and Lean translation were developed simultaneously
with integrated differential testing to ensure semantic equivalence.

**Test Results:**
- Passed Runs: 5/5
- Minimum Cases per Run: 5
- Total Test Time: 229.33s

### Stage 2: Formal Specification and Proof

The Lean implementation has been formally specified and proven via Aristotle.

## Evidence Summary

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Differential Tests | ✓ PASSED |
| Lake Build | ✓ PASSED |
| Formal Proofs | ✓ COMPLETE |

## Conclusion

The implementation has been verified through both empirical testing and formal proofs.
